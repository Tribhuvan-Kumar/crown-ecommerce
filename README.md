## Categories

We have five main product categories:

1. Men's
2. Women
3. Hats
4. Jackets
5. Sneakers

### Browsing by Categories

You can easily browse products within a specific category. Just click on the category name, and you'll be redirected to a page featuring products exclusively from that category.

### Shop Everything

If you prefer to shop without selecting a specific category, you can simply click on the "Shop" button in the navbar. This will display all available categories along with a selection of 4 products from each category.

## Shopping Cart

Once you find a product you like, click on the "Add to Cart" button on the product card. The selected item will be added to your shopping cart. You can access your shopping cart at any time by clicking on the cart icon located on the top right corner of the navbar.

## Checkout

To complete your purchase, click on the "Shop Cart" icon and then click "Go to Checkout." This will redirect you to the checkout page, where you can finalize your order.

- Modify the quantity of each product.
- Remove items if you no longer want them.
